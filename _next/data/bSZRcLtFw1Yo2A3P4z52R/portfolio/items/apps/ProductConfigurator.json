The task involved designing the scene and conducting light baking for the products using Blender. To facilitate texture swapping on individual parts of the product, I created a custom material in BabylonJS using their Node Material Editor. This approach allowed us to seamlessly integrate textures produced from Blender.\r\n\r\nFor the user interface, I utilized React to build a responsive and intuitive UI. The configurator is encapsulated within a custom HTML component, enabling clients to effortlessly incorporate it into their websites and tailor its styling to align with their branding. This design choice not only enhances flexibility but also simplifies future updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Technology Used\r\n\r\n- TypeScript\r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n- React\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"webP\" : true,\r\n      \"thumb\" : false,\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"large\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/apps/ProdcutConfigurator/ScreenShots/1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/apps/ProdcutConfigurator/ScreenShots/2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/apps/ProdcutConfigurator/ScreenShots/3.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Video\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/axTNcOhWmrU?si=B2wHPe5m-Z1H-fnn)\r\n\r\n","id":"ProductConfigurator"},"__N_SSG":true}
