It is a project I built using the Divine Voxel Engine to thoroughly test the engine's capabilities and identify potential bottlenecks in developing a game of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe game is not yet complete, but it boasts a multitude of cool features. For example, it features structures that generate around the world, which\r\n\r\nare procedurally generated using a wave function collapse algorithm.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a spell crafting system. You can craft spells to perform various actions, such as creating a line of voxels from one spot to another or removing large sections of the world. There is significant potential in this feature.\r\n\r\nYou can craft spells and perform different actions at various types of altars, which you must craft. You can find these altars, though unactivated, in temples. Once you activate an altar, it will transform from a metal outline into a set of solid voxels.\r\n\r\nThis game continues to exist within *Crystalline Bliss*, as *Crystalline Bliss* is essentially set inside the world of *Dream Space Infinite*. I may update this game one day, but currently, I think it is too similar to Minecraft for me to consider continuing with it seriously. Perhaps I will find a more innovative approach to take with it in the future.\r\n\r\n##### Technology Used\r\n\r\n- TypeScript\r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n- WebPac\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[Play Online](https://dreamspaceinfinite.com/)\r\n\r\n#### Screen Shots\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"webP\" : true,\r\n      \"thumb\" : false,\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"large\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/3.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/4.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/5.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/DreamSpaceInfinite/ScreenShots/6.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Video\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXEcXCHvt5w?si=1Msh6F3E_2yBvIXS)\r\n\r\n","id":"DreamSpaceInfinite"},"__N_SSG":true}
