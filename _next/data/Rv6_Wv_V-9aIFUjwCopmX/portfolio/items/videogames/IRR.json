It's written in TypeScript, uses Babylon.Js as the game engine, and is made into a desktop app with Electron.\r\n\r\nIt is infinite runner game with RPG elements. Each level is generated from a given set of starting seeds. These seeds are feed into a random number generated that is used to generate the level. So, each level can be basically replicated given the same seed. \r\n\r\nRecently I decided to re-make the way the models are rendered. Instead of using normal model or thin instances I decided to move it all to voxel based system. \r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n##### Full List Of Technology Used\r\n\r\n- TypeScript\r\n  - The whole game is written in TypeScript. \r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n  - The game engine that it runs on.\r\n- Electron\r\n  - Used to make it into a desktop app.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nThe original version of the game before I decided to switch it to voxel base used Baylon.Js's solid particle system. This had many limitations which quickly came apparent. To optimize things I tried moving the physics into a whole separate thread. But in the voxel version this is not necessary. \r\n\r\nHowever, audio still runs in it's own separate thread. Specifically I use a hidden window that is created through Electron and send it what sounds to play and stop from the main thread through Electron's Inter Process Communication API.\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"link\" : \"https://github.com/Divine-Star-Software/DivineStar-InfiniteAstralRealmRunner\",\r\n        \"center\": false,\r\n        \"type\" : \"post\",\r\n        \"size\" : \"medium\",\r\n        \"text\" : \"View On GitHub\"\r\n    }\r\n](button)\r\n\r\n#### Video\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/quDXMZtgW-M)","id":"IRR"},"__N_SSG":true}
