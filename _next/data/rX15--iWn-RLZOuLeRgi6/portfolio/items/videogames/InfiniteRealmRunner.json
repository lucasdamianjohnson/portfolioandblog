It was my first real attempt at a producorial based game. I developed it using TypeScript and BabylonJs. Everything just ran as an Electron app. \r\n\r\nThe whole point of the game was to invoke a dream-like experience running through atmospheric worlds that would occasionally have interesting things to look at. For instance the world with the water and the docks you would find houses occasionally. \r\n\r\nThe game was pretty interesting and atmospheric. I did try to eventually re-create it with my voxel engine but at the time it was not performant enough to really create what I wanted. Plus having the ability to have free movement over the whole world seemed more interesting to me. Maybe once I have rewrote some of my voxel engine with WASM or compute shaders I will revisit the concept. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Technology Used\r\n\r\n- TypeScript\r\n- Electron\r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n\r\n#### Screen Shots\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"webP\" : true,\r\n      \"thumb\" : false,\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"large\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/InfiniteRealmRunner/ScreenShots/1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/InfiniteRealmRunner/ScreenShots/2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/InfiniteRealmRunner/ScreenShots/3.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/InfiniteRealmRunner/ScreenShots/4.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/games/InfiniteRealmRunner/ScreenShots/5.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Video\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/quDXMZtgW-M?si=vjCNz99oo72anQGT)\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Us-U-7O-J6g?si=Bk1BEiOYSR1GAE1E)","id":"InfiniteRealmRunner"},"__N_SSG":true}
