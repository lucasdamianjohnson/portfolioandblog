I created the design according to her request. She uses it to sell her art work. \r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\nI set this site up to be easy to use for Evie. So, that meant I had to handle all of the Woo-Commerce integration myself. Otherwise it is just a standard WordPress and Woo-Commence site. \r\n\r\n- WordPress\r\n  - Used to create and manage the site.\r\n- Woo-Commerce\r\n  - Used for the e-commence.\r\n- Site Ground\r\n  - I host the site on Site Ground. \r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n\r\nI used a base theme to get started with the design.  Evie wanted the site's color pallet to be the same as her logo. She also wanted to have a rustic look. So, first I spent a long time looking through many photos to find the perfect picture of homey rustic looking wood to place the logo upon. Then I heavily edited the theme to match her requirements. After a few revisions she okayed the site and that is what currently is live.\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"link\" : \"https://www.mixhomesteaddesigns.com/\",\r\n        \"center\": false,\r\n        \"type\" : \"post\",\r\n        \"size\" : \"medium\",\r\n        \"text\" : \"View Live\"\r\n    }\r\n](button)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots \r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"webP\" : true,\r\n      \"thumb\" : false,\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"large\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MixHomeSteadDesign/banner.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MixHomeSteadDesign/ss1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MixHomeSteadDesign/ss2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MixHomeSteadDesign/ss3.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MixHomeSteadDesign/ss4.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","id":"MixHomeSteadDesigns"},"__N_SSG":true}
