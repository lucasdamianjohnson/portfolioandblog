But this one I am the most proud of. My original site was a WordPress site. It was always a pain to make updates or add updates. \r\n\r\nWith my my new site I decided I wanted something really simple and straight forward. So, I set out to create a static site that uses Next.Js and markdown.\r\n\r\nThe homepage is a just a normal page with a canvas as the background. I used Babylon.Js to create the animation and CSS to fix it to the background. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n##### Full List Of Technology Used\r\n\r\n- Next.Js\r\n  - Used to build and export the whole site.\r\n- Markdown\r\n  - All the content for the site is written in Markdown files and converted into HTML through Next.Js. \r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n  - Used to create the 3D animation on the homepage. \r\n- React\r\n  - I use a custom React component library I wrote.\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n\r\nThe design of the site is meant to be minimalist, modern, and professional. \r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[View Story Book Of Components](https://divine-star-software.github.io/DivineStarSiteReactComponentsStoryBook/)\r\n\r\n","id":"Portfolio-Site"},"__N_SSG":true}
