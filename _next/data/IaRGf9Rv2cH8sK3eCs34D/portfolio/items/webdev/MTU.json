This sorter allows people to search for any of their  demonstrations. The demonstrations are stored in a google sheet. I used  JavaScript to make Ajax request on a PHP file to get this to work. The  PHP code uses a degree of fuzzy search to improve searching.\r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/mindtrekkers/demonstrations/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/mindtrekkers) \r\n\r\n###### Research Project Sorter\r\n\r\n I completely rebuilt this for the new CMS. It pulls from multiple databases to make a searchable list of all the current research projects.  \r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/research/about/current/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/research-projects) \r\n\r\n###### Campus Directory \r\n\r\nI rebuilt this tool using PHP,  JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It loads search results via Ajax request and  has a complicated set of filters. \r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/directory/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/campus-directory) \r\n\r\n###### Mentions Page\r\n\r\nI created the generation and pagination for this page. \r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/news/mentions/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/mentions) \r\n\r\n##### Back Facing Projects\r\n\r\n###### Site Export And Move\r\n\r\nWhen I first started for UMC they were using Rythmx which was an older  Java-based CMS. I was tasked to find a way to export all the sites into  files that OU Campus could read. So, I made this script that takes a  site map and grabs all the necessary data and produces a copy of the  site that can be simply uploaded to OU Campus.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/site-export) \r\n\r\n###### Image Crop Gadget\r\n\r\nI was tasked with remaking the image cropping gadget for OU campus. I  have basically rebuilt this gadget. The gadget allows a user to crop  images sizes that we pre-determine. This allows all images on the site  to have desired aspect ratios for the best cross-platform experience.  The gadget also stores previous crops in a database so new sizes can be  cropped with the same selected area.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/image-gadget) \r\n\r\n###### Publish All Content Types Gadget\r\n\r\nThis is another gadget for OU Campus. It allows you to publish out all files of a specific type.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/publish-all-gadget) \r\n\r\n###### Image Crop Script\r\n\r\nThis is a script that I made that we inject on pages to crop down the size of images to increase mobile performance.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/image-crop) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","id":"MTU"},"__N_SSG":true}
