But this one I am the most proud of. My original site was a WordPress site. It was always a pain to make updates or add new content. \r\n\r\nWith my my new site I decided I wanted something really simple and straight forward. That is why I went with Next.Js and Markdown. \r\n\r\nThe homepage is a just a normal page with a canvas as the background. I used Babylon.Js to create the animation and CSS to use it as the background. \r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\nAll content for the site is stored in Markdown files. I use the package gray-matter to parse the front matter from the Markdown files. I also use bits of JSON in the files to create things like image galleries, buttons, and video embeds.\r\n\r\nThe homepage 3D scene is something that I spent a bit of time on. I created the textures for the models and animated them. I used different trigonometric functions to create the animations of the models and the camera. To create the particles I used a Babylon.Js particle system with a custom config for the particles. \r\n\r\nThe rest of my site uses components from my react component library. \r\n\r\n##### Full List Of Technology Used\r\n\r\n- Next.Js\r\n  - Used to build and export the whole site.\r\n- Markdown\r\n  - All the content for the site is written in Markdown files and converted into HTML through Next.Js. \r\n  - I use the package gray-matter to parse front matter from the markdown files. \r\n  - The markdown files have bits of JSON which I use to create elements like image galleries, buttons, and video embeds.\r\n- Babylon.Js\r\n  - I used it to create the 3D animation on the homepage. \r\n  - I used the glow layer to create the glowing effect on the models. \r\n- React\r\n  - All components expect react-markdown were made by me. \r\n  - On top of components specific to the site I used a React component library I wrote.\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n\r\nThe design of the site is minimalist, modern, and sleek. I wanted it to be a simple yet enjoyable experience. Like a Zen garden filled with beautiful art. \r\n\r\nI went with a bluish-cyan because I feel it is a very \"techy\" color and shows off my temperate. Which is always chill and calm.\r\n\r\nBut simply my design philosophy is this: S.E.E. Which stands for Simple, Elegant, and Effective. You can kind of talk about it but you must see and feel it to believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[View Story Book Of Components](https://divine-star-software.github.io/DivineStarSiteReactComponentsStoryBook/)\r\n\r\n","id":"Portfolio-Site"},"__N_SSG":true}
