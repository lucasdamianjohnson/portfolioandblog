The department handled the creation and styling of all university's websites and social media. Here you will find a list of some of the projects that I worked on. \r\n\r\n#### Projects\r\n\r\n##### Front Facing Projects\r\n\r\nThese are some projects that I worked on that are available to the general public to view. \r\n\r\n###### Mind Trekker Demonstrations Sorter \r\n\r\n**About**\r\n\r\nThis is a tool for teachers and students to easily search through the MTU's organization Mind Trekkers demonstrations. \r\n\r\nAll of the data for the demonstrations are stored in a google sheet. I wrote a PHP script the uses the google sheet API to pull the data and transform it into HTML. \r\n\r\nThe live search uses jQuery to filter through the results. There are data tags stored on each demonstration accordion that the scripts check. \r\n\r\nThe script uses fuzzy search to improve results when searching for a project by a name. \r\n\r\nThis was a cool project to work on simply because I volunteered before for Mind Trekkers several times. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"medium\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/mt-ss1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/mt-ss2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n       {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/mt-ss3.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/mindtrekkers/demonstrations/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/mindtrekkers) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Research Project Sorter\r\n\r\n**About**\r\n\r\nThis is a tool that makes it easy to see what projects are being worked on currently for different departments. The tool exist for several departments and for each one it pull for the needed databases. \r\n\r\nThe hardest part when building this tool was creating the complex MySQL queries to pull data from different tables and databases and combine them together. \r\n\r\n **Screenshots**\r\n\r\n ```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"medium\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/r-ss1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/r-ss2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n       {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/r-ss3.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n ```\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/research/about/current/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/research-projects) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Campus Directory \r\n\r\n**About**\r\n\r\nThis is a tool to search for active students and faculty.  It allows you to add multiple search conditions. \r\n\r\nI was tasked with completely rebuilding this tool. It uses jQuery for the front end and PHP script that connects with the needed databases to get the data.  \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"medium\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/cd-ss1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n       {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/cd-ss2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n       {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/cd-ss3.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/cd-ss4.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/directory/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/campus-directory) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Mentions Page\r\n\r\n**About**\r\n\r\nThis is page that shows all the news article that Michigan Technological University was mentioned in. \r\n\r\nI created the script that pulls from the databases and generates all the links to the articles and I created the pagination. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n```RICHDATA\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"image-gallery\",\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"gallery\": {\r\n      \"popup\": false,\r\n      \"imageSize\": \"medium\",\r\n      \"imageType\": \"post\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"images\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/m-ss1.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/m-ss2.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n       {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/m-ss3.jpg\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"src\": \"/images/portfolio/webdev/MTU/m-ss4.jpg\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n[View Live](https://www.mtu.edu/news/mentions/) \r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/mentions) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Back Facing Projects\r\n\r\nThis are projects that I worked that were either for the site's backend or for the site's CMS.\r\n\r\n###### Site Export And Move\r\n\r\nWhen I first started for UMC they were using Rythmx which was an older  Java-based CMS. I was tasked to find a way to export all the sites into  files that OU Campus could read. So, I made this script that takes a  site map and grabs all the necessary data and produces a copy of the  site that can be simply uploaded to OU Campus.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/site-export) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Image Crop Gadget\r\n\r\nI was tasked with remaking the image cropping gadget for OU campus. I  have basically rebuilt this gadget. The gadget allows a user to crop  images sizes that we pre-determine. This allows all images on the site  to have desired aspect ratios for the best cross-platform experience.  The gadget also stores previous crops in a database so new sizes can be  cropped with the same selected area.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/image-gadget) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Publish All Content Types Gadget\r\n\r\nThis is another gadget for OU Campus. It allows you to publish out all files of a specific type.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/publish-all-gadget) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Image Crop Script\r\n\r\nThis is a script that I made that we inject on pages to crop down the size of images to increase mobile performance.\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/lucasdamianjohnson/MTUProjects/tree/main/image-crop) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","id":"MTU"},"__N_SSG":true}
