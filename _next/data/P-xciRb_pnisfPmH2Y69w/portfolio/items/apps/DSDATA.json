I spent a few days and converted an old NPM package into a modern ES6 package. And then I wrote a helper class to wrap it all together.\r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n##### Full List Of Technology Used\r\n\r\n- TypeScript\r\n  - The whole library is written in TypeScript. \r\n- NodeJS\r\n- NPM\r\n  - Used to host and install the package.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nI created this because I needed it for a few projects that I am working on. One of them being the voxel engine. Voxel data can really big really fast. So, in order reasonably store the data is must be compressed. When I looked into compressing the data I did not find an easy way to do so. That's when I found the original package called LZMA-JS and decided to convert it into something that I could easily use anywhere. \r\n\r\n#### Links\r\n\r\n[View On NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsdata)\r\n\r\n[View On GitHub](https://github.com/Divine-Star-Software/DivineStarData)\r\n\r\n","id":"DSDATA"},"__N_SSG":true}
