I was part of a team and together for a whole school year developed a game together. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea of orbital drift is that you would do platforming on different planets and jump to other ones with the goal of finding the portal to the next level. It made use of Unityâ€™s physics engine a lot and we used Wwise for the audio implementation. \r\n\r\nIt was an overall fun and challenging experience that prepared me for the work I am doing now. I did not know Unity at the time as I was more familiar with game maker and web development. And working with a team for the first on a project like that was difficult put we pulled through. I did make the final presentation video which had a cool retro/synth wave theme which was also the theme of the game. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Technology Used\r\n\r\n- C#\r\n- Visual Studio\r\n- Unity \r\n- Wwise\r\n\r\n#### Video\r\n\r\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7EvoLs5BCE)\r\n","id":"OrbitalDrift"},"__N_SSG":true}
